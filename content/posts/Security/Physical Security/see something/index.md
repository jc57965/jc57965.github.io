## Setup

I have taken the last year to try and make my homelab as simple as possible hence why I like Unraid UI. i run most of my homelab service on my nas in docker containers and with the exception of a few all of my services are running from the Unraid community store with just a few docker compose files. the ability to simply hit update when a update is available for services in unraid is a huge plus verses the other solutions I've had in the past where I used Proxmox with a vm from docker or using the great proxmox scripts repo to run services that still required to post a line of code in each container to update the service.


## Conclusion

I've been using a homelab setup for a while now. I've been using it for my personal projects and for my self study projects. with the exception of a few upgrades I would like to make this has served me well for the better part of the last year.
